## Key Technical Features

- **Smart Chord Rotation**: Never shows the same chord twice in a row (unless only one chord is selected)
- **Right Hand Focus**: Visual keyboard highlights show right hand notes across octaves 3-5, properly positioned relative to middle C
- **Proper Fingering Display**: Each chord shows correct finger numbers (1-3-5 pattern for right hand triads)
  - 1 = Thumb, 2 = Index, 3 = Middle, 4 = Ring, 5 = Pinky
  - Standard fingering based on piano pedagogy best practices
  - Displayed clearly within highlighted notes for easy learning
- **Enharmonic Note Matching**: Correctly highlights chords with flats (Eb, Bb, Ab) even though keyboard shows sharps (D#, A#, G#)
- **Instant Sound Control**: Pause and Stop buttons immediately silence any playing sounds
- **Single Chord Mode**: Sound plays correctly each time even when practicing just one chord
- **Optimized Performance**: Lazy-loaded piano samples with proper async handling
