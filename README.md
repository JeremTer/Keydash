# ðŸŽ¹ Piano Chord Practice Tool

A beautiful, interactive piano chord practice application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Speed Practice**: Timed mode with automatic chord changes and countdown timer (1-10 seconds)
  - **Beginner Learning**: Self-paced mode where you reveal chords manually when ready - no time pressure!
- **Visual Piano Keyboard**: Interactive SVG piano keyboard with green chord highlighting
  - Middle C positioned at the center of the keyboard
  - Right hand notes (octave 4) highlighted on the RIGHT side of middle C
  - **Finger numbers displayed on each highlighted note** (1=thumb, 3=middle, 5=pinky)
  - All chord notes highlighted in the same color for clarity
  - Standard 1-3-5 fingering for all basic triads (root position)
  - Extended keyboard range (C3-E5) to display all chord notes correctly
- **Piano Sound Playback**: Hear each chord played automatically when it appears
  - Beautiful sound icon button to easily mute/unmute (speaker icon with sound waves)
  - Mobile-friendly large button with clear visual states (blue when on, gray when off)
  - Real piano samples (Salamander Grand Piano) using Tone.js
  - **Sound duration matches your countdown timer** - hear the chord for the full duration
  - **Mobile browser support** - works on iOS Safari and other mobile browsers
  - Sound stops immediately when pausing or stopping practice
  - Works correctly even when practicing a single chord repeatedly
- **Bilingual Support**: Switch between English and French notation (C, D, E vs Do, RÃ©, Mi)
- **Multiple Practice Modes**:
  - **Learn All**: Practice all available chords randomly (never shows the same chord twice in a row)
  - **Learn Selected**: Choose specific chords to practice
- **Customizable Filters**:
  - Chord types (Major, Minor, or both)
  - Difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, or all)
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Chord name displayed prominently (centered in Beginner mode, left-aligned in Speed mode)
  - **Note names displayed below chord name** when revealed (e.g., "C - E - G")
  - Circular countdown timer with color-coded warnings (blue â†’ orange â†’ red) - Speed Practice mode only
  - Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Stable Layout**: No jumping or shifting when starting, stopping, or pausing
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with smooth animations

## Key Technical Features

- **Smart Chord Rotation**: Never shows the same chord twice in a row (unless only one chord is selected)
- **Right Hand Focus**: Visual keyboard highlights show right hand notes across octaves 3-5, properly positioned relative to middle C
- **Proper Fingering Display**: Each chord shows correct finger numbers (1-3-5 pattern for right hand triads)
  - 1 = Thumb, 2 = Index, 3 = Middle, 4 = Ring, 5 = Pinky
  - Standard fingering based on piano pedagogy best practices
  - Displayed clearly within highlighted notes for easy learning
- **Enharmonic Note Matching**: Correctly highlights chords with flats (Eb, Bb, Ab) even though keyboard shows sharps (D#, A#, G#)
- **Instant Sound Control**: Pause and Stop buttons immediately silence any playing sounds
- **Single Chord Mode**: Sound plays correctly each time even when practicing just one chord
- **Optimized Performance**: Lazy-loaded piano samples with proper async handling
